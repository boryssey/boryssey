## Hi there 👋

I am a Full-Stack developer with experience developing Web Apps, APIs, and Browser Extensions.

  - ⚙️ I mostly use React for frontend and Node for backend development (Express.js, Fastify)
  - 🌐 Visit [my website](https://boryssey.com) to learn more about me, read some articles I wrote, or see some photos I've taken. My CV is also there!
  - 🛠️ Right now, I am working on [chate2e.com](https://chate2e.com) in my spare time. You can find the repository pinned below 👇
  - Also, working on a [Picture-in-Picture Anything](https://github.com/boryssey/picture-in-picture-anything). It's a browser extension that allows you to put any element into a Picture-in-Picture window.
